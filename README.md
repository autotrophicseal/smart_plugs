Automated Christmas lights with Raspberry pi

Started by installing raspbian OS on my raspberry pi 4
Installed headless

## Sniffing Codes

Followed the tutorial from https://www.instructables.com/Super-Simple-Raspberry-Pi-433MHz-Home-Automation/ at first. Need a way to know the bits that get sent from the remote to the smart plug so I can mimic it with my transmitter. To do so use a 433mgh reciever and run the code that the link provides.

Login to pi via ssh
ssh pi@____________

create github repo and clone onto separate computer
download all code to it and push to repo
clone repo onto raspberry pi
I cloned into the desktop folder idk why.
